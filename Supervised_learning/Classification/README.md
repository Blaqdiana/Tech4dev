## Project Description:
Financial institutions aim to automate the loan eligibility process in real-time, based on customer details provided in online 
application forms. With factors such as "Gender", "Married", "Education", "Dependents", "Income", "Loan_Amount", 
"Credit History", and others taken into consideration, the goal is to identify eligible customer segments for specific loan 
amounts. By automating this process, the institutions can efficiently target these eligible customers, streamlining the loan 
approval process and reducing manual errors in applicant selection.

## Project Objective:
Use machine learning algorithims to develop predictive models that predict loan approval status based on historical applicant 
data. It will automatically select eligible candidates, reducing manual processing and improving efficiency.   
**Dataset**
You can find the dataset here: [Loan Aproval Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)

## **Project Workflow:**
***Data Exploration***
- Library Importation : Importing relevant Libraries for the project
- Data Loading: Loading the dataset(s) into your preferred data analysis environment.
- Data Overview: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable. Check for missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.

***Data Preprocessing***
- Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, and inconsistencies.
- Encoding Categorical Variable: Convert categorical variables (such as gender, marital status, and education) into numerical representations, using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Feature Engineering: Normalize or scale numerical or create new features if necessary improve model performance.

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) / Data Visualization***
- Univariate Analysis: Visualize the distribution of individual features.
- Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features and the target variable (loan approval).
  
***Model Building***
- Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.  
- Data Imbalance: Handling data imbalances if any.
- Model Selection: Choose desired machine learning algorithms and tune prefered hyperparameters using cross-validation.
- Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices and ROC curves.

***Conclusion***   
Summarize the findings from the analysis, including insights about important features, model performance, and recommendations for loan approval.
